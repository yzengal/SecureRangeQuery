// step1. create spatial index: grid index
// step2. add laplace noise in each grid
// step3. each silo send the grid index to server
// step4. server computes the intersected grids and send their IDs to each silo
// step5. silo sends back the record in each grid based on the perturbation.
// step6. server checks whether the records satisfies the query range, record recall and precision.


===== extension
// step5. server sends the encrpted query point and radius to the server
// step6. silo computes the encrpted distance, and put it into a polynoimal term, along with the radius
// step7. silo sends them to the server, server decrypts, filter, and send them back.
// step8. silo gets the filter result, and send the encrypt data to server,
// step9. server collect the data, and send them to client
// step10. client receive the encrypted data, decrypted them, and filter out those with dummy ID
